# MuddSub CV2 Object Detection Networks Source Code
The code in this repository is source code to design, develop, train, test, and use YOLO networks for object detection on the sub. This readme will briefly outline how the code works.

# The `datamanager` Module
The `datamanager` package in this repository deals with the i/o of data for the network. It does a number of operations that are outlined in detail in it's own read-me, located at `/datamanager/README.md`.

# Network Development
The `netdev` package here assists with the development and testing of custom YOLO network architectures. It's operations are all easily accesible from the terminal and it has it's own read-me at `/netdev/README.md` that has more detailed information about it's usage.
