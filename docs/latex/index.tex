Mudd\+Sub is a student-\/lead team which competes in the international \href{http://robosub.org}{\texttt{ robosub}} competition.

This repository represents a fresh start on the code base, and is thus incomplete. Further, the documentation is equally incomplete. If you have question about code which has not yet been migrated to this repo, or about any missing documentation, contact Seth Isaacson at \href{mailto:sisaacson@hmc.edu}{\texttt{ sisaacson@hmc.\+edu}}.

Our software is partitioned as follows\+:\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Core}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
The Core repository provides simple tools for sharing information, managing the robot\textquotesingle{}s state, and other utilitites. It also holds the U\+R\+DF descirptions of the robot.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{Vision}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
Vision holds all of our commputer vision tools.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{controls}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
Controls provides the vehicle dynamics and control systems.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsection{hydrophones}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
The Hydrophones repository provides the firmware and software for processing acoustic signals. The overall goal is to find the direction-\/of-\/arrival of an acoustic signal by receiving it on four hydrophones.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsubsection{motion planning}\label{index_autotoc_md11}
Motion planning generates abstract trajectories which the robot follows.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsubsection{sim}\label{index_autotoc_md12}
Sim holds packages to interface with our simulator, which is based on the open-\/source U\+W\+Sim. The controls repository also contains code to simulate vehicle dynamics.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsubsection{slam}\label{index_autotoc_md13}
S\+L\+AM will eventually hold code to conduct simulataneous localization and mapping.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsubsection{thirdparty}\label{index_autotoc_md14}
We use various third-\/party tools to service our autonomy stack. Notably, we use the wonderful controls toolbox, which provides interfaces for system linearization and optimal controllers.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsubsection{builds}\label{index_autotoc_md15}
Builds holds three metapackages which are used for building different configurations.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item muddsub\+\_\+primary builds code which is run on the robot.
\item muddsub\+\_\+sim builds muddsub\+\_\+primary, plus simulation-\/related code.
\item muddsub\+\_\+raspi builds the code which runs raspberry pis. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
