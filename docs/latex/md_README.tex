This all needs to be in Ubuntu, preferably 18.\+04. Other linux distributions can in theory be used, but not all packages are guaranteed to be supported. For example, in Arch linux, everything except simulation is supported. These instructions are all written for Ubuntu. If you want to use a different distribution, you\textquotesingle{}ll have to figure out how to install the packages in the distro.

Start by following \href{http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu}{\texttt{ these instructions}} to install ros melodic.

You\textquotesingle{}ll need a catkin workspace, which can be created by opening a terminal and running 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir -\/p \string~/catkin\_ws/src}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \string~/catkin\_ws}
\DoxyCodeLine{catkin build}
\end{DoxyCode}


Enter the directory and clone this repository\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \string~/catkin\_ws/src }
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/MuddSub/MuddSub.git -\/-\/recurse-\/submodules -\/j8}
\end{DoxyCode}


You\textquotesingle{}ll need to install a few dependencies to get everything working\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install ros-\/melodic-\/uwsim}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install python2.7-\/dev}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install python-\/catkin-\/tools}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install ros-\/melodic-\/tf}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install ros-\/melodic-\/urdf}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install libeigen3-\/dev}
\end{DoxyCode}


The first is optional, and provides the tools we use for simulation. The second is a dependency for a library we use for controls. The third gives an alternate build tool to the one which comes standard with R\+OS. We build with {\ttfamily catkin build} instead of {\ttfamily catkin\+\_\+make} because it allows standard C\+Make projects to be compiled within our workspace.

With that said, this is a good opportunity to build!


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd .. }
\DoxyCodeLine{catkin build}
\end{DoxyCode}
