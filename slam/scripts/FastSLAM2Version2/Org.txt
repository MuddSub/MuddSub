RunFastSlam2 or Simulator
- has a dataset

FastSLAM2: interface with dataset. (DONE)
params: named tuple
@external interface:
 - addMeasurement: external interface
 - addControl: external interface
 - getPoseAndLandmarks ... has helper function compute_avg
@internal functions
 - _createParticle()
 - _updateMotion: call particles to update motion 
 - _updateMeas: call particles to update measurements
    - Measurement data class:  include an option for known correspondence --> maybe named tuple  
 - _resample

Particle
 - updateMotion: call Robot for motion update
 - updateMeas
 - updatePoseDistribution -> use the measurement and an EKF to update the current pose distribution
   ### *Note: in between these two functions, we need to sample the pose ###
 - getLandmarkLikelihood -> return both proposed particle pose distribution and prob of association for that landmark 
   (replace sample pose in landmark)
 - updateObservedLandmark, updateUnobservedLandmark, initLandmark...

EKF: data only, replacing landmark.py

Util
  - wrapToPi....
